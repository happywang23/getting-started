# Step 1 Provide your github details (only if you are an enrolled student in the class).

https://goo.gl/forms/wUWy5IvfHVprr6vW2

# Step 2 Read the [syllabus](syllabus.md)

# Step 3 - Set up the development environment - Option 1 (Preferred)

## VirtualBox

Download and install Oracle VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/

### Vagrant

Download and install Vagrant from https://www.vagrantup.com/

You may also want to install the Vagrant plugin for VirtualBox Guest Additions. 
The base box used comes with the Guest Additions for 5.0.18, and the plugin will take care 
to install the correct Guest Additions if your version of VirtualBox differs from that.
To do so simply call 

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
	
### Download the repo and launch!

Clone the getting started git repository. 

    git clone https://github.com/CS3281-2016/getting-started.git
    
    
if you do not have git on the host machine you can download the repository as a zip from here
  
  https://github.com/CS3281-2016/getting-started/archive/master.zip

Open a shell in the directory containing the `Vagrantfile` and run

    vagrant up

This will take a while when you run it for the first time.
Vagrant will download the base box, launch the virtual machine and install the software mentioned above.


**Note** - Please check that there were no errors during this step. Any errors might lead to the case where you wont find clion in the vm. If such an error happens, you try running ``vagrant reload``

### Login and finish installation

When the software installation is complete, log into the VM (user and password are "vagrant").

#### CLion

Inside the VM, open a terminal and run 

    /opt/clion-2016.2.1/bin/clion.sh
	
It wil start the actual installation wizard for CLion. 

If you want to set up desktop shortcut for clion - please see the instructions available here

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.1/installation-and-launching.html#desktop_shortcut

#### Clion License

Get the student license from https://www.jetbrains.com/student/. 

Follow the getting started instructions from https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.1/quick-start-guide.html

# Alternate Instructions for Step 3- Option 2 (Only if the above steps did not work for you)

- Install latest virtuabox
- Install the extension package
- Download the appliance http://scope.isis.vanderbilt.edu/old/files/cs281_vbox.ova
- Then, you can double click on the downloaded ova file and it should self import.
             - Please choose the option that initializes all network addresses. 
             - Also, you can adjust the number of CPUs and memory while importing (this will depend upon the capacity of  your machine).
- Set up Clion as described in Option 1

# Alternate Instructions for Step 3 - Option 3 (Only if the above steps did not work for you)

If the vagrant approach does not work for you, create a new xubuntu vm manually on your machine. 

  Follow the instructions in this video
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_DpFhT_euI

Then you will have to install the following packages. 

    sudo apt-get install cmake libboost-all-dev vim git -y

Get clion manually using the following commands

	sudo wget -q http://download.jetbrains.com/cpp/CLion-${CLION_VERSION}.tar.gz
	sudo tar xfz CLion-${CLION_VERSION}.tar.gz -C /opt
	
Inside the VM, open a terminal and run 

    /opt/clion-2016.2.1/bin/clion.sh
	
It wil start the actual installation wizard for CLion. 

If you want to set up desktop shortcut for clion - please see the instructions available here

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.1/installation-and-launching.html#desktop_shortcut

#### Clion License

Get the student license from https://www.jetbrains.com/student/. 

Follow the getting started instructions from https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.1/quick-start-guide.html

# Step 3 - Set up SSH access to github. 

 Follow the instructions provided here
	
	https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/

# Step 4 - Review the following materials

   - See this quick tour video at https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/documentation/
   - Read https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.2/quick-start-guide.html. 
   - Watch the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUZyoAnPdCY for understanding how to debug with clion
   
**Note** - As you read the quick start guide, you will realize that clion uses cmake (https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/) for describing the compilation and linking procedures. However, in this class, we will provide you the cmake files. You will only need to edit them using the Clion GUI as shown in the quick start guide.

# Step 5 - Set up the class examples repository in clion.

- Follow the instructions shown in this video [https://youtu.be/V76maDEsl-8](https://youtu.be/V76maDEsl-8)
- The examples repostiory is available here: [https://github.com/CS3281-2016/examples](https://github.com/CS3281-2016/examples).
- The lecture notes are located at https://github.com/CS3281-2016/lectures
