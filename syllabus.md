## Course Description

This is an introductory course on operating
systems (OS) principles. Students will learn basic concepts in OS design
and implementation. The course content will consist of a balance between
theory/concepts and practical hands-on material. Students will be
evaluated on (a) the theory/concepts through in-class quizzes, problem
solving homeworks and a final project, and (b) the practical issues in
operating systems through a series of programming assignments. Active
participation of students in class discussions and other forums is
highly encouraged.


## Prerequisites

CS 231 and CS 251. Because an OS must make effective
use of the underlying hardware, students learning OS concepts need to
have a basic understanding of computer architecture. These concepts are
covered in CS 231. Because programming assignments are a major part of
the course, students must be comfortable with programming and debugging.
Most of the programming will be done in C and C++. I suggest the use of
Jetbrains Clion (<https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/>) as the IDE. We will
use github for managing the assignments and course examples. Piazza will
be used as the discussion forum. Course content will be disseminated via
Oak.

**Please refer to https://github.com/CS3281-2016/getting-started for setting up the necessary development environment.**

## Text(s)

We are going to follow an online textbook in the course.
The book is freely available at
<http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/>. 

During the class extra reading
material will be provided as required. This course will require you to
do self-reading based on the given reading assignments. There will be
short reading quizzes that will be due based on reading assignments.

## Course Policies

Submissions will be due by midnight on the day
mentioned in the assignment and homework description. Late submissions
will be penalized with an automatic **20 percent penalty per day** (applied relative to the graded score for the submission). **No
collaborations unless explicitly permitted**. 

The Vanderbilt Honor Code
will govern work done. ANY VIOLATIONS WILL RESULT in the case to be
reported to the honor council. You are welcome to refer to the online
sources for your assignments. However, you must not copy the code and
must provide citation of the source of inspiration if do refer to the
online sites. All work will be submitted via github.

### Programming Assignments Programming assignments will be tested
using Ubuntu and are expected to be developed and run in that
environment. We will provide you instructions for setting up your
environment. Any submission that does not compile will be penalized **50%**.


### Evaluation: The following grading criteria are tentative and are
subject to change. Each graded item in this course will be assigned a
certain number of points. Your final grade will be computed as the total
number of points you achieved divided by the number of points possible.
The instructors reserve the right to apply a curve to the final result.
In general, we will attempt to achieve the following composition:


### Grading Criteria

| Category        | Percentage  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Reading assignments       | 10% | 
| In-class quizzes      | 30% |
| Home assignments  | 40%    |
|  Final Project  | 20%      |

There is an optional final quiz which will take place at the time allotted for the final exam. Your grade on this optional final quiz can be used to replace your lowest in-class quiz grade.

### Letter Grade Distribution




| Score        | Letter  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| >= 93.00    |   A      |
| 90.00 - 92.99  |  A-   |
| 87.00 - 89.99 | B+     |
| 83.00 - 86.99  | B     |
| 80.00 - 82.99  | B-     |
| 77.00 - 79.99  | C+  |
| 73.00 - 76.99  | C  |
| 70.00 - 72.99  | C-  |
| 67.00 - 69.99  | D+  |
| 63.00 - 66.99  | D  |
| 60.00 - 62.99  | D-  |
| <= 59.99   |  F  |


## Disability Statement

Vanderbilt is committed to equal opportunity
for students with disabilities. If you have a physical or learning
disability, you should ask the Opportunity Development Center to assist
you in identifying yourself to your instructors as having a disability,
so that appropriate accommodation may be provided. Without notification,
your instructors assume that you have no disabilities or seek no
accommodation.

## Emergency Evacuation Plan

 In the event of a fire or other emergency,
the occupants of this class should collect their coats and personal
belongings and leave the building using the stairs. VANDERBILT
UNIVERSITY POLICY FORBIDS REENTRY TO A BUILDING IN WHICH AN ALARM HAS
OCCURRED WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION BY VANDERBILT SECURITY. If, in
consequence of a disability, you anticipate the need for assistance,
please discuss that need with the instructors.

If a tornado siren is heard, please go to the designated tornado
shelters. FGH 134 (Jacobâ€™s Auditorium), which is next door to our
classroom, is a designated tornado shelter.

## Course Calendar

The course will cover the following topics through the semester in the
order specified.

-   Overview of C programming language.

-   History of operating systems and why we need them.

-   Architecture of a modern computing system: We will review how system
    is booted and the role played by BIOS, bootloader, operating system
    kernel and the user processes.

-   Process: Creation and Management

-   Scheduling policies: How CPU is arbitrated between different tasks.

-   Memory Management: How memory is divided up among processes. We will
    discuss paging, virtual memory and architectural elements required
    for memory management.

-   Concurrency: Threads and Mutual Exclusion

-   Interprocess communication: message queues, pipes, shared memory and
    an overview of sockets

-   Devices and file systems

-   Optional topics if time permits: security policies, distributed
    systems and a comparison with other operating systems.
